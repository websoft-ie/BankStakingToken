# What is Staking?

Someone is said to have a stake in a venture when they contribute some assets in exchange of exercising some level of control, influence, or participation in its activities.

In the cryptocurrency world this is understood as giving users some kind of right or reward for as long as they donâ€™t transfer some tokens in their possession. A staking mechanism usually encourages token holding against token trading, which in turn is expected to drive up the token valuation.


To build this staking mechanism we will need:

*   A staking token.
*   Data structures to keep track of stakes, stakeholders and rewards.
*   Methods to create and remove stakes.
*   A rewards system.
